This is Jython 2.5a3 - an alpha version.

Installation was done using the installer into this directory.

Then the "jython-compelete.jar" was renamed "jython.jar" - this is
required due to some jython cache directory searching functionality

Additionally, I added a "javalibs" directory, which is something we had 
when we build 2.1.1 from code.  This appears to be something needed for
building and running old version - the new jython-complete.jar seems
to have everything it needs.  We'll see.

Also, the db currently has a hardcoded reference to include/jython/javalibs
and if it doesn't exist, the db refuses to start.
