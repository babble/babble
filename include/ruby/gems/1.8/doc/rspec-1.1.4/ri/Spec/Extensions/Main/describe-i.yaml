- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creates and returns a class that includes the ExampleGroupMethods module.
    Which ExampleGroup type is created depends on the directory of the file calling
    this method. For example, Spec::Rails will use different classes for specs living
    in <tt>spec/models</tt>, <tt>spec/helpers</tt>, <tt>spec/views</tt> and <tt>spec/controllers</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'It is also possible to override autodiscovery of the example group type with
    an options Hash as the last argument:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  describe &quot;name&quot;, :type =&gt; :something_special do ...\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The reason for using different behaviour classes is to have different matcher
    methods available from within the <tt>describe</tt> block.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: See Spec::Example::ExampleFactory#register for details about how to register
    special implementations.
