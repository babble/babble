  body: This allows for comparing the mock to other objects that proxy such as ActiveRecords
    belongs_to proxy objects By making the other object run the comparison, we're
    sure the call gets delegated to the proxy target This is an unfortunate side effect
    from ActiveRecord, but this should be safe unless the RHS redefines == in a nonsensical
    manner
