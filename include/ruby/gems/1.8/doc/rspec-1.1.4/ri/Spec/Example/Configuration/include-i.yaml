- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Declares modules to be included in multiple example groups (<tt>describe</tt>
    blocks). With no :type, the modules listed will be included in all example groups.
    Use :type to restrict the inclusion to a subset of example groups. The value assigned
    to :type should be a key that maps to a class that is either a subclass of Spec::Example::ExampleGroup
    or extends Spec::Example::ExampleGroupMethods and includes Spec::Example::ExampleMethods
