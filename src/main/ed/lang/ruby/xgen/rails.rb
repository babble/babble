=begin
To get Rails to work with babble, you need to create two files. First,
create a file named _init.rb in the root directory of your Rails app that
looks like this:

# Look for the requested URI in the public directory. If not found, pass it on
# to the 10gen Rails dispatcher.
$mapUrlToJxpFile = Proc.new do |uri, req|
  uri = '/index.html' if uri == '/'
  if File.exist?(File.join($local.getRoot.getPath, 'public', uri[1..-1]))
    "/public" + uri
  else
    "public/xgen_dispatch.rb"
  end
end

Next, add public/xgen_dispatch.rb:

require 'xgen/rails'
load 'xgen/rails/cgi_env.rb'
Dispatcher.dispatch
=end


# RAILS_ENV is set to the name of your cloud environment. If none is specified
# (for example, you are running locally), then 'development' is used.
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = $scope['__instance__'].getEnvironmentName() || 'development'

# The default production cloud environment name is "www". If we see that, use
# "production" instead.
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'production' if ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'www'

require 'xgen/mongo'
require File.join($local.getRoot.getPath, "config/environment") unless defined?(RAILS_ROOT)
require 'dispatcher'
require 'xgen/rails/dispatcher'
