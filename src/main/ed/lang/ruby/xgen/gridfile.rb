# A GridFile file lives in the database. GridFiles can be retrieved by name.
#
# GridFiles have attributes. You can read/write them using [] and []=. One
# interesting one is 'contentType', which tells Babble how to serve the file.
#
# Example:
#
#   GridFile.open("myfile", 'w') { |f|
#     f['contentType'] = 'text/plain'  # or f.contentType = 'text/plain'
#     f['creator'] = 'Spongebob Squarepants'
#     f.puts "Hello, GridFS!"
#   }
#   GridFile.open("myfile", 'r') { |f|
#     puts f.read
#     puts f['contentType']            # or f.contentType
#     puts f['creator']
#   }
#   # => Hello, GridFS!
#   # => text/plain
#   # => Spongebob Squarepants
#   GridFile.exist?("myfile")
#   # => true
#   GridFile.delete("myfile")
#
# A file's data is not saved to the database until the close method is called.
# close is automatically called at the end of the block passed to open.
#
# The database connection defaults to the global <code>$db</code>. You can set
# the connection using GridFile.connection= and read it with
# GridFile.connection.
#
#   # Set the connection to something besides $db
#   GridFile.connection = connect('my-database')
#
# A GridFile is a StringIO that reads from the database when it is created and
# writes to the database when it is closed. <em>This will change in the
# future, so that a file's contents are not read into memory right away.</em>
